# CA-Project-1-Calculating-Inputted-Weight-And-Shipping
Fool-proof Python syntax input weight/shipping application as first self-learning assignment.

This project is one of my first since I finished my computer science course in Spring 2022. Having that course gave a passion that made me take up self-learning coding as a full-time hobby. 

Initially, there was difficulty in terms of making a fool-proof input function. I struggled with trying to use ".isnumeric" until I researched "try" "except". After numerous attempts, I was able to ensure a numeric-only entry from the user.
